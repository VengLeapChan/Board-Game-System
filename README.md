# Board Game System

## Overview
The **Board Game System** is a modular and extensible framework for building various types of board games. Designed using Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and adhering to SOLID principles, this system provides a structured and scalable approach to game development in C#.

## Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Built with extensibility in mind, allowing easy integration of new game mechanics.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implements inheritance and polymorphism to provide a reusable codebase.
- **Game Board System**: Defines a flexible board structure adaptable to different game rules.
- **Unit System**: Supports unit extensions while maintaining shared functionalities.
- **Design Patterns**: Incorporates common design patterns to improve maintainability and scalability.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes system architecture, class hierarchies, and testing procedures.

## Technologies Used
- **C#**
- **MSTest**
